for Red Hat OpenStack Platform (OSP) releases.

The name `znoyder` is a play of Silesian word *znojdywacz* and its English
meaning (*finder*).


# Usage examples

After installing, the `znoyder` command is available to use.
For testing purposes, you may rely on `tox -e run --` command
or provided `run.sh` shell script as well.

Simply running `znoyder` with any valid subcommand will result in displaying
the default fields of corresponding data.

There is a basic filtering implemented that allows to limit and narrow results,
for example to a specific release, project or component â€“ for `packages` subcommand.
It is also possible to select only certain fields as result, using the `--output` option.
